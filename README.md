This is an audio recording app that allows you to manipulate the recorded audio

This is my first project for my Udacity iOS Nanodegree. 

The app lets you record your voice. The play page lets you play the recorded audio using 4 voice manipulations:

1. Slow
2. Fast
3. Chipmunk
4. Darth Vader

RecordSoundViewController.swift contains the code that records the audio. 

PlaySoundsViewController.swift contains code that manipulates the audio and code for playback. 

RecordedAudio.swift stores the audio.
